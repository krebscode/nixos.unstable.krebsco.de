Mic92 convinced me to try out unstable again.
:code:`31c72ce2 -> f66d7823`

new problems i managed to solve
-------------------------------
**awesome4.0 introduced breaking api changes**

Due to the fact that the whole awesomecfg is code, everything exploded. My
temporary solution was to replace some of the old config default parts with the
new ones from the default config but it was no fun.
Some stuff is marked as deprecated (:code:`use gears instead`) but i have no idea
how.

 * Full diff: http://cgit.euer.krebsco.de/stockholm/commit/?id=0ef6adccc7a9bcbff99fbe093593aa95a8eae7fa
 * Documentation on github for the awesomewm change: https://github.com/awesomeWM/awesome/issues/967
 * New Guides for default config: https://awesomewm.org/apidoc/documentation/05-awesomerc.md.html

Testing new awesome config via:

.. code-block:: bash

  Xephyr :1 -ac -br -noreset -screen 800x600
  DISPLAY=:1.0 awesome -c ~/rc.lua


broken stuff i will fix by waiting for a new release
----------------------------------------------------

new and solved with update
--------------------------

* **services.journalbeat**
* **Grafana 4.1** - JUST WORKED!
